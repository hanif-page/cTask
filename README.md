### cTask

This project is finished. We always keep trying to improve this project, so we're apologize if there's still a bug or an unexpected result from the site.

Next update : 
- Fix "not working login session", because sometimes it didn't really keep the user account logged in at the same browser.
- ~The icon tab is not appearing, on /user route (find out why!)~ Haven't found the solution yet.
- There's a bug when we click the "clear all task" button. So if we successfully clear all the task, then the "clear all task" button itself gone, and it won't appear again when u add a new task again (the task isn't updating). The current solution now is, after adding the new task, refresh the page. Find the proper solution for this specific problem!
