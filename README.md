### cTask

This project is finished. We always keep trying to improve this project, so we're apologize if there's still a bug or an unexpected result from the site.

Next update : 
- ~Build a loading screen (for the page loading) and loading text (while loading all the task getting displayed).~
- Fix "not working login session", because sometimes it didn't really keep the user account logged in at the same browser.
- ~Fix "not appearing flash message (from task.js)", and fix "not closing success/error banner when getting clicked (on index page)"~
- ~Build the "update task data in the UI side, but don't have to reload"~
- ~The icon tab is not appearing, on /user route (find out why!)~ Haven't found the solution yet.
